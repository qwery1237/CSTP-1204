A1 : Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Postfix Notation
====


This activity is to highlight the Postfix Notation (or the Reverse Polish Notation) to represent arithmetic expressions and to illustrate the use of stacks in evaluating such expressions.

_The Postfix Notation allows one to unambiguously express arithmetic expressions without using parentheses._

### Suggested Reading
+ Wikipedia entry on [Postfix Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
+ Java's [Stack](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) class

### Tasks

+ Using the provided skeleton code, implement a method to evaluate an arithmetic expression given in Postfix notation.
	+ You are expected to support only the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
+ If the provided expression string is not in the correct form then, when evaluating the expression, a `MalformedExpressionException` should be thrown.
+ Write JUnit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation.

### Submitting Your Work

+ You should submit a Github repository link
